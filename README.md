`frontend/` contains the frontend. In that directory, run `yarn build --release` to build a release build or start a development version with `yarn start`.

`backend/` contains the backend. In that directory, start local dev with `yarn run dev`. For a release server, `yarn start`.

This directory also contains a `Procfile`, which runs a release build for the frontend and serves it all with the backend on Heroku, at <http://fullstack-phonebook-walther.herokuapp.com/>
