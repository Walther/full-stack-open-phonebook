# full-stack-open-phonebook

`frontend/` contains the frontend. In that directory, run `yarn build --release` to build a release build or start a development version with `yarn start`.

Root directory contains the backend. Start local dev with `yarn run dev`. For a release server, `yarn start`.

Note that for the sake of simplicity, the frontend is built manually ahead-of-time and committed to the repo for the actual deployment. Yep, this isn't ideal.
